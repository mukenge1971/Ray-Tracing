A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


## Creating elements (objects)

 

Elements are defined mainly as structures with basic properties consisting on  color and at least two parameters of dimensions and position.


## Brightness 
To change brightness, you need only to act on the property "Light" intensity
 




## Managing the camera 
Three properties are essential for defining the camera position : look_at (the camera front direction), look_from (the camera position) and up the camera top direction

You can directly change these parameters to make the camera move or us rotate_yaw method to rotate the camera around y-axis and or the translate method to move the camera from a point to another without changing its essential directions.
